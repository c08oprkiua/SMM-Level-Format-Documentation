# Super Mario Maker Level Format Documentation
Comprehensive and hopefully easy to follow explanation of the contents of a Super Mario Maker (1) .cdt level file.

This exists because while people clearly know how these work based off of the numerious editors and other things using these files out there, I could not find any standalone, simple to read documentation for the file's layout, such as where to find the metadata (name, author, etc.). So, I created this, so that people can easily read up on where to find various pieces of content within the file, as to create their own implementations of level readers or even editors, or just gain a better understanding of these files.

# Table of Contents
* [File overview](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/SMM-Level-Format-Documentation/blob/main/overview.md)
* [The metadata of the file](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/SMM-Level-Format-Documentation/blob/main/metadata.md)
* Object layout/contents (coming soon)


# Disclaimer and Credits
I'm just a readme, not a cop, but please use this information responsibly. I don't want to see this information used for level plagarizing or intentionally "hacked"/unstable level creation to upload malociously to level databases.

Also, this documentation is very WIP, and is based on me reading through code that I'm not *100%* familiar with, so it is prone to inaccuracies. I will try my best to check for said possible inaccuracies by putting my money where my mouth by making a file reader based on my own documentation (more on that at 5).
