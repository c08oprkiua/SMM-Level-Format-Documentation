# SMM-Level-Format-Documentation
Simple to read explanation of the layout of a Mario Maker (1) .cdt level file

This exists because while people clearly know how these work, I could not find any simple to read documentation for the file's layout, such as where the metadata (name, author, etc.) is. So, I created this, so that people can easily read up on where to find things as to create their own implementations of level readers or even editors.

I'm just a readme, not a cop, but please use this information responsibly. I don't want to see this information used for level plagarizing or intentionally hacked/unstable level creation to upload malociously to level databases. 

Also, this documentation is very WIP, and is based on me reading through code that I'm not *100%* familiar with, so it is prone to inaccuracies. I will try my best to check for said possible inaccuracies by putting my money where my mouth by making a file reader based on my own documentation (more on that at 5).
